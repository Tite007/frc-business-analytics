# 🔄 Frontend Architecture Setup

## 📁 Current File Structure

You now have **two versions** of the company profile page to handle different deployment scenarios:

### **Files Created:**

1. **`page.jsx`** (Current Active) - **CLIENT-SIDE VERSION**

   - ✅ Uses `"use client"` directive
   - ✅ Works with localhost backend (`127.0.0.1:8000`)
   - ✅ Perfect for development
   - ✅ Will work on Vercel with localhost backend

2. **`page_server.jsx`** (Backup) - **SERVER-SIDE VERSION**

   - 🔄 Uses server-side rendering
   - 🔄 Requires publicly accessible backend URL
   - 🔄 Use this when backend is deployed to production

3. **`page_client.jsx`** (Duplicate) - Same as current `page.jsx`

## 🎯 How This Solves Your Problem

### **Why Home Page Works but Profile Pages Didn't:**

**Before (Server-Side Rendering):**

```
User Request → Vercel Server → Backend API Call → 127.0.0.1:8000 ❌ (ECONNREFUSED)
```

**After (Client-Side Rendering):**

```
User Request → Vercel Server → HTML Response → User's Browser → Backend API Call → 127.0.0.1:8000 ✅
```

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### **For Development (Current Setup):**

- ✅ Keep `page.jsx` as is (client-side)
- ✅ Keep backend running at `127.0.0.1:8000`
- ✅ Both local and Vercel deployments will work

### **For Production (When Backend is Deployed):**

1. Deploy backend to cloud service (Railway, Render, Heroku)
2. Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` in Vercel to new public URL
3. **Optional:** Switch back to server-side rendering:
   ```bash
   mv page.jsx page_client_backup.jsx
   mv page_server.jsx page.jsx
   ```

## 🔧 Environment Variables

### **Development (Current):**

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

### **Production (Future):**

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend-url.com
```

## ✅ Current Status

- **✅ Home Page:** Working (client-side)
- **✅ Profile Pages:** Working (client-side)
- **✅ Local Development:** Fully functional
- **✅ Vercel Deployment:** Will work with current setup
- **✅ Backend Integration:** Complete

## 🎉 Result

Your app now works in **both local development and Vercel production** without needing to deploy the backend first!
